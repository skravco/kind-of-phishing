# Kind-of-Phishing 

## Overview
This Flask application serves as a demonstration tool to showcase how phishing attacks work at a high level. It provides a simulated submission form, which is commonly used as a pretext in phishing attempts. The application demonstrates the potential risks associated with providing personal information to untrusted sources.

## Functionality
- **Feedback Submission Form**: Users are presented with a form where they can open helpdesk ticker. This form collects personal information such as customer name, email, phone number etc.
- **Data Collection**: Upon submission, the application stores the provided information in a database. This illustrates how attackers can collect sensitive data through deceptive forms.
- **Email Notification**: Each feedback submission triggers an email notification to a predetermined email address. This mimics the behavior of phishing attacks where attackers receive stolen information via email.
